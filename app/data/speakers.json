But finding a balance between usability, security and mobile platforms' restrictions is complicated.</p><p>We will start with the security design scheme, then select the proper encryption library, then implement the flow, and prepare for incidents. Now — think about it — cryptography is only chapter 3 in OWASP MASVS (7 chapters in general). Even the best cryptography will fail if basic security controls are badly implemented.</p><p>Points we will go through the difference between \"locking\" and \"encrypting\", the difference between password and encryption key, how to sync passwords between devices, what exactly to store in keychain/keystore, how to use proper cryptography (AES CBC or AES GCM, random salt? IV? padding? what a hell is this mess), how to use biometrics (we don’t want to bother user, let’s use biometric keychain, but what if users will change their fingerprints — shall we invalidate all passwords?), updating encryption version (imagine, vulnerability is discovered in our library or app — how to update cipher, and softly migrate users to the new cipher, if users don’t even have a clue that encryption was versioned).</p><p>In the end, this is only one simple JIRA ticket \"let's encrypt the notes\" from the eyes of security software engineer :)</p>",

How often are you greeted with a wondrous permissions prompt craving to send you messages to the lock screen? What about onboarding cards you dismiss without reading? How about app notifications, streaming endlessly and loudly your way? And what about the infamous \"feedback\" or \"chat\" buttons floating on the sie? All these solutions desperately craving for our attention, yet as a result pushing customers away, often irrevocably. In this talk, Vitaly Friedman, co-founder of Smashing Magazine and creative lead and UX consultant, will explore better approaches for onboarding and offboarding, authentication patterns and infamous GDPR consent cookie prompts, annoying permission requests and disruptive notifications requests. Plus, we'll learn how to deal with nasty CAPTCHAs, social sign-ins, shady third-parties, shaky connectivity issues and a few general privacy issues that often cost conversion. You'll walk away with a toolbox of techniques applicable to any mobile project — be it a native app, PWA or a good ol' responsive website.

Since the birth of Lambda, the FaaS movement had been wildly popular. The problem is we ended up with a stack where we have a bunch of functions for one-offs, a single well maintained deployment path for our main application, and perhaps a mix legacy VMs running particular workloads. If we're lucky, our main deployment path is using K8S and has nice pipelines, but everything else is pretty ad-hoc.</p><p>This approach has been defended because why invest in all the work required to deploy to K8S for all those apps? It's a lot of yaml files after all.</p><p>But now there's a new approach. With Knative, you can easily deploy your scripts to a Kubernetes cluster with just a simple bit of configuration. No custom frameworks, just a vanilla container running your functions and applications.</p><p>Learn how Knative and Google Cloud Run are changing how frontend developers deploy code!</p>",
